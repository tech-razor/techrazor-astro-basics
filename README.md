# Astro: Basics

This is a project that accompanies Section 2 of the Udemy course _Introduction to the Astro web framework_.

The project introduces the basic concepts of [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Branches

The branch names are of the format `[lecture-number]-[lecture-title]`, for example, `07-astro-components`.

Students are encouraged to compare their code with a particular branch to ensure they are on the right track.

The `RECAP.md` file inside each branch contains a summary of important concepts that were introduced in the corresponding lecture.
